Full instructions for this tutorial can be found in the [Security Camera Blueprint](https://www.twilio.com/wireless/blueprints/security-camera/). This repository includes all files neccessary to build the [Security Camera Blueprint](https://www.twilio.com/wireless/blueprints/security-camera/).

**Problem** All businesses require safety for their property, assets, and employees, but most cannot afford or rely on a hired security team. If they had a low-cost, reliable, and technical security solution, there would be a peace of mind about the protection of their resources.


**Solution** Remove the hassle from remote monitoring with the best practices discussed in this Blueprint designed to accelerate your business development. We will create a Twilio-powered device that keeps watch over remote locations and alerts stakeholders of intrusions or safety concerns. Constantly monitoring, the device notifies stakeholders of intrusions that threaten assets or safety.


**Degree of Difficulty (1-5): 3**  This device requires some knowledge of Raspberry Pi, software installation, and some Linux features including the command line.

### What You’ll Need

Before we get started, here's a quick overview of what you'll need to build the Security Camera

**Materias lists**
Electronic Components
* [Twilio Programmable Wireless Starter Pack](https://www.twilio.com/console/wireless/sims/orders/new)
* [Wireless Security Camera shopping list](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/31BE0GL8116HE/ref=cm_wl_rlist_create)

The Wireless Starter Kit in the shopping list comes with an 8GB micro SD card. You will need a [microSD adapter](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-microSD-Memory-Adapter-MICROSD-ADAPTER/dp/B0047WZOOO/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1501698065&sr=1-4&keywords=micro+sd+card+to) if your computer has an SD port, or you can use a [USB adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Standard-Connector-Smartphones-Function/dp/B01BXSKPES/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1501697821&sr=8-6&keywords=micro+sd+to+sd+adapter) if necessary. This Blueprint assumes you have access to a USB modem, mouse, and HDMI connected monitor. Need a USB keyboard and mouse?
