# Security Camera Blueprint
### 3d-printed enclosure
This Security Camera Blueprint comes with CAD files designed for this 3D printout. You can find the CAD files here. Visit [Voodoo Manufacturing](https://voodoomfg.com/) to take advantage of their developer-first API driven 3d-printers to print out the models. Use [Sculpteo](http://sculpteo.com/) to print out the acrylic to cover the sides of the Security Camera.

**Note:** these files are optional and not necessary to construct this Blueprint.
